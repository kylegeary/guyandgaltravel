You really think you can fly that thing? Checkmate... What do they got in there? King Kong? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.



I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Just my luck, no ice. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Checkmate... Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Must go faster. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.



They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!



God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Life finds a way. Just my luck, no ice. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.



I was part of something special. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Yes, Yes, without the oops! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!
