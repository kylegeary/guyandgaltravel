Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?



You really think you can fly that thing? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.



Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.

You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists.



Yes, Yes, without the oops! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.
