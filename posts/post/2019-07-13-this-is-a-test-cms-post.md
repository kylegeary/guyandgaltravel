  Life finds a way. I was part of something special. I was part of something
  special. Checkmate... Must go faster. Hey, take a look at the earthlings.
  Goodbye! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's
  my chance. Checkmate...

  Just my luck, no ice. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Forget
  the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! We
  gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the
  OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it
  anymore!


  God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys
  God. Man creates Dinosaurs. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer
  virus. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of
  here! Did he just throw my cat out of the window?


  Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could,
  they didn't stop to think if they should. Do you have any idea how long it
  takes those cups to decompose. You're a very talented young man, with your own
  clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?


  Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?
  Checkmate... So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? We gotta burn the rain
  forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe
  if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
