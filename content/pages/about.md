# Meet Guy & Gal

Hey there! We’re Chris and Paige Fellows, newlyweds embarking on the ultimate around-the-world adventure: 365 days, 6 continents, 2 backpacks and countless memories to be made.

Follow us as we say goodbye to our 9-5 jobs and hello to living life to the fullest, one day and destination at a time.

#### Who’s that guy?

It’s Chris! Traveling has been a passion of mine since backpacking with my dad and grandpa in fifth grade. Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to immerse myself in many different cultures, while stretching myself beyond my comfort zone. All of this and more had made me who I am today – a history teacher, lifelong learner, and adventure seeker.

#### Who’s that gal?

It’s Paige! I’m 27 years old and realizing one of my oldest and dearest dreams – traveling the world. Seriously, someone pinch me! Travel has always brought an unexplainable peace and perspective to my life that few things do, and I can’t wait to dedicate a full year to what I love with my favorite guy. Bring on the world!
